# Number Compositions

The program displays all possible
combinations of sums of a number by checking
the first of the digits of each combination. It
then breaks it down into more digits if the
first digit of each combination is
greater than the number 1.
Combinations are stored in a stack except for
those whose first digit is 1. The
combinations that meet this criterion
are printed and do NOT go into the stack with the
other combinations.


The .c file contains the code and the .exe file is the executable. Run it from a command prompt so as to not let it close when it's done printing the result.
